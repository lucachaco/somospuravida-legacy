  testinomy: We Costa Ricans have the task to let the world know about our beautiful nation. What we did, what we are doing and what we are going to do!  Additionally, allow humanity to understand our precious way of living and experiencing a pure life. What we call in Spanish, PURA VIDA!  Pura Vida is more then a phrase and more then an attitude. Pura Vida is our essence, our soul and our identity. Is what we say when we greet. Is what we say when we farewell. Is what we wish to someone to have and is what we wish to someone to be. Pura Vida is what we are!
